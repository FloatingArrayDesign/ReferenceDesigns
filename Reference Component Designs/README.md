# Reference Component Designs

This folder contains design files for NREL's reference component designs, developed as part of the Floating Wind Array Design project. The designs include mooring systems and dynamic power cables, developed for three distinct U.S. locations. The designs vary in water depths, ranging from deep water (800 m) to intermediate (200 m) to to shallow (80 m), and metocean conditions. The design process and design details are described in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002980182500188X.

The design files are provided in two formats (1) MoorDyn input files and (2) FAModel onotology yamls. The ontology, which follows the IEA Wind Task 49 floating array ontology, is explained in detail at https://github.com/IEAWindTask49/Ontology.
