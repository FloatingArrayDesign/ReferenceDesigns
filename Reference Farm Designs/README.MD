# Reference Component Designs

This folder contains design files for NREL's reference array designs, developed as part of the Floating Wind Array Design project. The designs include platform layouts, cable routing, substation placement, mooring and cable designs, and anchor types developed for three distinct U.S. locations. The designs vary in water depths, ranging from deep water (800 m) to intermediate (200 m) to to shallow (80 m), and metocean conditions. The design process and design details will be described in an upcoming work.

The substation design is adapted from the Ph.D. thesis of  of F. Jorge Alcantara 
[F. Jorge Alcantara, Design of a Floating Foundation for an HVAC Off-
shore Substation, Ph.D. thesis, Universite de Liege, Belgium.].

The design files are provided in FAModel onotology yamls. The ontology, which follows the IEA Wind Task 49 floating array ontology, is explained in detail at https://github.com/IEAWindTask49/Ontology.
