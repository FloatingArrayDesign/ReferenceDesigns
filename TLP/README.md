# A 15-MW Tension Leg Platform

This folder contains design files for a tension-leg platform (TLP) design for the IEA Wind 15 MW reference turbine [1]. The TLP design includes variations for water depths ranging from 200 m to 1500 m. 

The design files are provided in the format of input files for OpenFAST v4.0.3 for the water depth of 800 m. Additional input files for the RAFT model and for other water depths will be added soon.

The design is described in a 2025 OMAE paper [2].
